dashing.net
===========

This version of [dashing.net](http://voiddog.github.com/dashing.net/) is a fork of the [dashing.net](http://sbarski.github.com/dashing.net/) direct .net port of the [dashing](http://shopify.github.com/dashing) framework originally created by Shopify.

Unlike the original port this version tries to use options available to it as a result of being based in .NET, whilst trying to preserve compatibility with the core elements of the original by Shopify.

[Check out the Shopify dashing homepage](http://shopify.github.com/dashing).
